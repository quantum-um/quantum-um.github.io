#### Leander Reascos

**About me:**
I am an MSc student at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT) working with the Theory of Quantum Nanostructures
research group at the [International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory](https://inl.int/). My research is centered
around using quantum computers to simulate and study quantum systems. I am interested in the
theoretical aspects of physics such as quantum systems and high-energy physics. I find it
fascinating to explore the potential of quantum computers in these fields. I'm eager to continue
this work and plan to pursue a Ph.D. degree after completing my Master's program.


#### Rodrigo Coelho

**About me:**
I am a MsC student at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT), and I am also affiliated
with [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt). My research interest is in the field of quantum
reinforcement learning, with a specific focus on variational Q-learning. I aim to explore how
variational quantum circuits can be used as function approximators in Q-learning algorithms to solve
ever-changing environments.
