#### Mafalda Alves [[personal site](https://mafaldaramoa.github.io/)]

**About me:**
I have an MSc in Engineering Physics and I am a PhD student working in quantum computing since
2022. I belong to the Quantum and Linear-Optical Computation (QLOC) research group at the
International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory (INL) and I am affiliated with the High-Assurance
Software Laboratory (HASLab). I am interested in NISQ-friendly algorithms for optimization and
simulation, especially adaptive variational quantum algorithms.

#### Michael Oliveira

**About me:**
I am Michael de Oliveira, a Ph.D. student at the [International Iberian Nanotechnology
Laboratory](https://inl.int/) and an [Edinburgh & Paris Quantum Virtual
Lab](https://www.ediparquantum.com/) member. My research focuses on the temporal structure of
quantum algorithms. Other topics of interest are quantum complexity theory and quantum secure-multi
party computation. Generally, I am interested in the fundamental distinctions between quantum and
classical computations/processes.
