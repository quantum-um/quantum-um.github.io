#### Luís Soares Barbosa

**About me:**

 


#### Luís Paulo Santos


**About me:**
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Informatics, [Universidade do
Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT). My research interests include Parallel Computing, Physically-based
Global Illumination and, more recently, Quantum Computing. Within this later context I am interested
on the development of algorithms that leverage the potential of near term NISQ
systems. Additionally, I am interested on the simulation of quantum circuits, in particular, on
leveraging highly efficient Monte Carlo simulations to speed up convergence rates.

#### Mafalda Alves
[[personal site](https://mafaldaramoa.github.io/)]

**About me:**
I have an MSc in Engineering Physics and I am a PhD student working in quantum computing since 2022.
I belong to the Quantum and Linear-Optical Computation (QLOC) research group at the [International
Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory](https://inl.int/) and I am affiliated with the [High-Assurance
Software Laboratory](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/haslab). I am interested in NISQ-friendly algorithms for optimization and
simulation, especially adaptive variational quantum algorithms.

#### Andrea D'Urbano

**About me:**

 


#### Michael Oliveira

**About me:**
I am Michael de Oliveira, a Ph.D. student at the [International Iberian Nanotechnology
Laboratory](https://inl.int/) and an [Edinburgh & Paris Quantum Virtual
Lab](https://www.ediparquantum.com/) member. My research focuses on the temporal structure of
quantum algorithms. Other topics of interest are quantum complexity theory and quantum secure-multi
party computation. Generally, I am interested in the fundamental distinctions between quantum and
classical computations/processes.

#### Jaime Santos
[[GitHub]](https://github.com/JaimePSantos)

**About me:**
I am a PhD student at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT) and [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/pt), with a research focus on quantum walks
and their applications such as search and optimization problems, mostly through numerical
analysis. I have a deep interest in the principles of quantum mechanics and how they can be utilized
to solve complex problems and drive innovation in various fields.

**About me:**

 


#### José Diogo Guimarães

**About me:**
I am an international Phs.D. student at University of Minho, Portugal and Institute of Theoretical
Physics of University of Ulm, Germany. My overall research field is quantum computation in the Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. More specifically, I am currently working on the development
of methods for simulating open systems on NISQ devices, using quantum error mitigation and other
suitable techniques to improve the accuracy of the simulations’ results.
