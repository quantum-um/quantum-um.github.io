#### Luís Paulo Santos


**About me:**
I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Informatics, [Universidade do
Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/PT). My research interests include Parallel Computing, Physically-based
Global Illumination and, more recently, Quantum Computing. Within this later context I am interested
