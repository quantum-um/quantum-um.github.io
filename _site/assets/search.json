    "content": "Information\nValid until the end of the 2022/23 academic year\n\nHour:\n14h00 (14pm WET)\n\nRoom:\n0.05 (Department of Informatics)\n\n\n\nDate:\n10 March 2023\n\nSpeakers:\nJosé Diogo Guimarães\n[slides]\n\nTitle:\nNoise-assisted digital quantum simulation of open systems\n\nAbstract:\nQuantum systems are inherently open and subject to environmental noise, which can have both\ndetrimental and beneficial effects on their dynamics. In particular, noise has been observed to\nenable novel functionalities in bio-molecular systems, making the simulation of their dynamics an\nimportant target for digital and analog quantum simulation. However, current quantum devices are\ntypically noisy, limiting their computational capabilities. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach that leverages the intrinsic noise of a quantum device to reduce the quantum computational\nresources required for simulating open quantum systems. We achieve this by combining quantum noise\ncharacterization methods with quantum error mitigation techniques, which allow us to transform and\ncontrol the intrinsic noise in a quantum circuit. Specifically, we selectively enhance or reduce\ndecoherence rates in the quantum circuit to achieve the desired simulation of open system\ndynamics. We describe our methods in detail and report on the results of noise characterization and\nquantum error mitigation on real and emulated IBM Quantum computers. We also provide estimates of\nthe experimental resource requirements for our techniques. We believe that this approach can pave\nthe way for new simulation techniques in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, where\ntheir intrinsic noise can be harnessed to assist quantum computations.\n\n\n\nDate:\n3 March 2023\n\nSpeakers:\nInês Dias and Vitor Fernandes\n[slides]\n\nTitle:\nTowards quantum concurrency (Part 1)\n\nAbstract:\nIn the classical setting, concurrency speeds up the execution of programs, which decreases their\nexecution time [1].  Currently, quantum computers must handle fault-tolerant hardware [2]. This\nfaulty-hardware is prone to noise, which affects the superposition time of qubits (the superposition\ntime of qubits is in the order of a few milliseconds [3]).\n\nWe then aim to bring the benefits of concurrency to the quantum setting. In order to study to what\nextent concurrency can help to mitigate noise in quantum programming, our goal is to define and\nimplement the semantics of a concurrent quantum language, which will in turn allow to simulate\nquantum concurrent programs.  To do that, we based our work on a concurrent imperative language\ndeveloped by Brookes [4].  In fact, our concurrent quantum language is an extension of said\nlanguage, by adding basic quantum features to it.\n\nIn this talk, we focus on the language developed by Brookes.  We present its syntax and operational\nsemantics. Additionally, we discuss the use of Parsec [5], a package of Haskell, in order to build a\nparser for this language, and also the implementation of its operational semantics in\nHaskell. Furthermore, we briefly discuss the syntax and the operational semantics of the quantum\nconcurrent language.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Cantrill, Bryan, and Jeff Bonwick. “Real-world concurrency.” Communications of the ACM 51.11 (2008): 34-39.\n\n[2] Nielsen, Michael A., and Isaac Chuang. “Quantum computation and quantum information.” (2002): 558-559.\n\n[3] Zhang, Yu, et al. “Optimizing quantum programs against decoherence: delaying qubits into quantum superposition.” 2019 International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE).

During the last round of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s\nPost-Quantum Cryptography contest (NIST-PQC)[1] it was concluded that the proposed quantum-resistant\ndigital signatures lacked variability, thus requiring further candidates. During the NIST-PQC’s\nthird round, NIST withdrew PICNIC, a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) candidate, from the schemes to be\nstandardized due to concerns with its security. However, NIST stated that upon further research and\ndevelopment, MPC schemes could provide promising candidates for standardization. The fact is that\nduring the NIST-PQC’s contest duration, several MPC schemes that improved upon PICNIC’s performance\nand security appeared [2,3]. A big problem with their implementations is that these often detach\nthemselves from the original scheme leading to doubts about their security. To solve this issue, the\ntoolchain Jasmin-EasyCrypt[4,5] emerged allowing one to link optimized implementations to the\noriginal scheme’s security claims. In this talk, we will detail what an MPC scheme is and how the\nJasmin-EasyCrypt toolchain can provide high-speed high-assurance software implementations with\nproofs over these concrete implementations instead of proofs over a theoretical scheme.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Status Report on the Third Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.

This scenario could prove to be\nuseful to quantify the advantage, if any, in using quantum resources in distributed quantum\ninformation processing, and in particular secure multi-party computation. The resource-theory\ndiscussion in [1] and the general framework presented in [2] and [3], allow to describe the\nnonclassicality in such scenarios, taking into account the causal structure of the experiment. We\nwill describe this approach and try to apply the methodologies presented in [3] to the easiest and\nthe most fundamental example of quantum multi-party computation: quantum secret sharing [4].\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Schmid, David, Denis Rosset, and Francesco Buscemi. “The type-independent resource theory of local operations and shared randomness.” Quantum 4 (2020): 262.\n\n[2] Wolfe, Elie, et al. “Quantifying Bell: The resource theory of nonclassicality of common-cause boxes.” Quantum 4 (2020): 280.\n\n[3] Zjawin, Beata, et al. “Quantifying EPR: the resource theory of nonclassicality of common-cause assemblages.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.10244 (2021).\n\n[4] Hillery, Mark, Vladimír Bužek, and André Berthiaume. “Quantum secret sharing.” Physical Review A 59.3 (1999): 1829.\n",
